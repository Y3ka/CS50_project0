                    <p>A graph is a diagram of points and lines connected to the points. It has at least one line joining a set of two vertices with no vertex connecting itself. 
                        The concept of graphs in graph theory stands up on some basic terms such as point, line, vertex, edge, degree of vertices, properties of graphs, etc. 
                        We will see these fundamentals of graph theory.</p>
                
                    <h3>Elements of a graph:</h3>

                    <p><span>Point:</span> A point is a particular position in a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional space. 
                        For better understanding, a point can be denoted by a letter or a figure. It can be represented with a dot.<br>
                        <span>Line:</span> A Line is a connection between two points. It can be represented with a solid line.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <image src="image/line.jpg" alt="schema of a line in a graph" style="position: relative; left: 5%;"></image>
                        <figcaption>Here, ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the points. The link between these two points is called a line.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p><span>Vertex:</span> A vertex is a point where multiple lines meet. It is also called a node. Similar to points, a vertex is also denoted by a letter.<br> 
                        <span>Edge:</span> An edge is the mathematical term for a line that connects two vertices. Many edges can be formed from a single vertex. 
                        Without a vertex, an edge cannot be formed. There must be a starting vertex and an ending vertex for an edge.</p>

                    <h3>Graph</h3>

                    <p>A graph ‘G’ is defined as G = (V, E) Where V is a set of all vertices and E is a set of all edges in the graph</p>
                    <figure>
                        <image src="image/graph.jpg" alt="schema of a graph"></image>
                        <figcaption>Here, ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the points. The link between these two points is called a line.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In the above example, ab, ac, cd, and bd are the edges of the graph. Similarly, a, b, c, and d are the vertices of the graph.</p>
                    <h3>Loop</h3>
                    <p>In a graph, if an edge is drawn from vertex to itself, it is called a loop.<br>
                       In the graph below, there are two loops which are formed at vertex a, and vertex b.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <image src="image/two_loops.jpg" alt="schema of a graph with two loops"></image>
                    </figure>

                    <h3>Degree of vertex</h3>

                    <p>It is the number of vertices adjacent to a vertex V. The notation is deg(V).<br>
                        In a simple graph with n number of vertices, the degree of any vertices is deg(v) ≤ n – 1 ∀ v ∈ G <br>
                        A vertex can form an edge with all other vertices except by itself. So the degree of a vertex will be up to the number of vertices in the graph minus 1. If there is a loop at any of the vertices, then it is not a Simple Graph.<br>
                        Degree of vertex can be considered under two cases of graphs:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Undirected Graph</li>
                        <li>Directed Graph</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>1. Degree of Vertex in an Undirected Graph</h4>
                    <p>An undirected graph has no directed edges. Consider the following example :</p>
                    <figure>
                        <image src="image/undirected_graph.jpg" alt="schema of an undirected graph"></image>
                    </figure>
                    <ul>
                        <li>deg(a) = 2, as there are 2 edges meeting at vertex ‘a’.</li>
                        <li>deg(b) = 3, as there are 3 edges meeting at vertex ‘b’.</li>
                        <li>deg(c) = 1, as there is 1 edge formed at vertex ‘c’. 'c' is called a pendent vertex</li>
                        <li>deg(d) = 2, as there are 2 edges meeting at vertex ‘d’.</li>
                        <li>deg(a) = 2, as there are 2 edges meeting at vertex ‘a’.</li>
                        <li>deg(e) = 0, as there are 0 edges formed at vertex ‘e’. 'e' is called a isolated vertex </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Degree of Vertex in a Directed Graph</h4>
                    <p>In a directed graph, each vertex has an indegree and an outdegree.<br>
                        Indegree of vertex V is the number of edges which are coming into the vertex V (noted deg-(V)).<br>
                        Outdegree of vertex V is the number of edges which are going out from the vertex V (noted deg+(V).</p>
                    <p>Consider the following example fo which the indegree and outdegree vertices are shown in the table:</p>
