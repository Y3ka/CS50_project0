CS50's Web programming with Python and Javascript

My project is a website, named GraphExpert, dedicated to the presentation of graph theory and some algorithms which are link to it.

You will find in the folder:
- 4 html files corresponding to the four pages of the website (homePage.html, Basics.html, BFS.html, DFS.html).
- a sass folder with the css stylesheet used for the html pages.
- an image folder containing the images used.

Meeting requirements:
- As required the website contains four .html pages (homePage.html, Basics.html, BFS.html, DFS.html).
- There are five lists (you can find at least one in each file).
- There is a table in Basics.html.
- There is more than one image (you can find at least one image on each page).
- There is one stylesheet file.
- The stylesheet has more than 5 selectors and more than 5 different properties. The #id selector is used for the header
and .class is used several times.
- The stylesheet contains two @media query. It removes the website logo in the header and change the position and size of the text when the screen size becomes smaller.
- I used the Bootstrap "btn-primary" component and used Bootstrap columns in each html file to separate the page between navigation bar and the main text.
- I used one scss variable ($typeface), nesting (in #header for example) and inheritance (%tableitem).
