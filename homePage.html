                    <h2>What is GraphExpert ?</h2>
                    <p>GraphExpert is a website dedicated to graph theory and algorithms link to it. The web site was created as part of the project 0 for the CS50 web programming class. It aims at developing knowledge about graphs, and can help you undertand notions and algorithms either for your studies or for preparing a coding interview (you need to have at least basics knowledge of graphs to pass coding interviews !).</p>
                    <p>The web site was entirely developed by me, a french engineering student in computer science. It should be noted that this is the version rendered for validating project 0 but not the final version of the web site.</p>

                    <h2>What can I find ?</h2>
                    <p>You can see and choose on the right the content currently available on the web site. It is recommended to start by reading the section on graph basics to make it easier to understand the algorithms treated in the other sections. You will see the terminoly and representations that are essential for this field.</p>
                    <p>Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are two very famous algorithms for traversing or searching tree or graph data structure. For its part, Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.</p>
