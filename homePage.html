                    <h2>What is GraphExpert ?</h2>
                    <p>GraphExpert is a website dedicated to graph theory and algorithms link to it. The website was created as part of the project 0 for the CS50 web programming class. It aims at developing knowledge about graphs, and can help you undertand notions and algorithms either for your studies or for preparing a coding interview (you need to have at least basics knowledge of graphs to pass coding interviews !).</p>
                    <p>The website was entirely developed by me, a french engineering student in computer science. It should be noted that this is the version rendered for validating project 0 but not the final version of the web site.</p>

                    <h2>What can I find ?</h2>
                    <p>You can see and choose on the right the content currently available on the web site. It is recommended to start by reading the section on graph basics to make it easier to understand the algorithms treated in the other sections. You will see the terminoly and representations that are essential for this field.</p>
                    <p>Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are two very famous algorithms for traversing or searching tree or graph data structure. The code given for these algorithms is in Python.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What's next ?</h2>
                    <p>As I previously said, this website was made for the project 0 of the CS50 class. I want to focus on the class and on the other projects for now but maybe I will continue it and add more content later.<br>
                    A page on Dijkstra's algorithm and Prim's algorithm as well as improving the basics page would be the next steps. Actually it is interesting for me because it also makes me revise and work on algorithms. </p>
                    
                    <h2>Useful links</h2>
                    <p>I think the following links provide good resources, look at it if you are interested :</p>
